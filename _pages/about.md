I am a PhD student in computer science at the University of Waterloo. My research focuses on fluid simulations with applications in computer graphics and I am supervised by [Dr. Christopher Batty](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/). My research has been featured in [Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzkmwy/computer-animation-physics-christopher-batty-asmr), [80 Level](https://80.lv/articles/research-adaptive-framework-for-fluid-simulation-002sgr-006sdf/) and the [SIGGRAPH 2019 Technical Papers Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhDr3Rs5fTU).

I also work part-time for [SideFX Software](https://www.sidefx.com/) as a software developer for their Houdini FX software package. I have designed several new features for their fluid simulation pipeline, such as the surface tension and suction fluid tools (16.0), narrow-band FLIP (16.5, 17.0, 17.5), air incompressibility (16.5), new ocean simulation tools (guided volumes and boundary layer) (16.0), and adaptive pressure projection (18.0). My adaptive viscosity research project has also been implemented as a plug-in to Houdini (17.5). My work has been featured on the Discovery Channel and my [Masterclass](https://vimeo.com/209763376) video, highlighting the new features I designed for Houdini 16, has over 45 thousand views.
