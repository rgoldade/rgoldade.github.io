I am a PhD student in computer science at the University of Waterloo. My research focuses on fluid simulations with applications in computer graphics and I am supervised by [Dr. Christopher Batty](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/). My research as been featured in [Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzkmwy/computer-animation-physics-christopher-batty-asmr), [80 Level](https://80.lv/articles/research-adaptive-framework-for-fluid-simulation-002sgr-006sdf/) and the [SIGGRAPH 2019 Technical Papers Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhDr3Rs5fTU).

I also work part-time for [SideFX Software](https://www.sidefx.com/) as a software developer. I have designed several new features for their fluid simulation pipeline, such as the surface tension and suction fluid tools, narrow-band FLIP, and new ocean simulation tools (guided volumes and boundary layer). My [Masterclass](https://vimeo.com/209763376) video, highlighting the new features I designed for Houdini 16, has over 40 thousand views.
