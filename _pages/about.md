I recently joined Facebook Reality Labs in Pittsburgh as a Research Engineer!

I'm also a soon-to-be-finished PhD student in computer science at the University of Waterloo. My research focuses on fluid simulations with applications in computer graphics and I am supervised by [Dr. Christopher Batty](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/). My research has been featured in [Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzkmwy/computer-animation-physics-christopher-batty-asmr), [80 Level](https://80.lv/articles/research-adaptive-framework-for-fluid-simulation-002sgr-006sdf/), the SIGGRAPH [2019](https://youtu.be/EhDr3Rs5fTU?t=16) and [2020](https://youtu.be/jYdMKdRUq_8?t=63) Technical Papers Preview, and [Two Minute Papers](https://youtu.be/MD_k3p4MH-A). My PhD research has been incorporate into the VFX software package, Houdini, as the air incompressibilty features (16.5) and adaptive viscosity (18.5).

During my PhD, I also worked part-time for [SideFX Software](https://www.sidefx.com/) as a software developer for their Houdini FX software package. I designed several new features for their fluid simulation pipeline, such as the surface tension and suction fluid tools (16.0), narrow-band FLIP (16.5, 17.0, 17.5), air incompressibility (16.5), new ocean simulation tools (guided volumes and boundary layer) (16.0), and adaptive pressure projection (18.0), and adaptive viscosity (18.5). Both my adaptive viscosity and reduced fluids research projects have been implemented as plug-ins to Houdini. My work with SideFX has been featured on the Discovery Channel and my [Masterclass](https://vimeo.com/209763376) video, highlighting the new features I designed for Houdini 16, has over 45 thousand views.
